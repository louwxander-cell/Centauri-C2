RXTOOLS 25.0.0
New features in RxTools installer:
1. The sbf2sbf conversion tool has been added to RxTools. The sbf2sbf executable is avail-
able in the installation directory.
RxTools installer differences introduced in RxTools v19.0.0
Issues resolved in RxTools installer:
1. The Linux 64-bit installer now includes a plugin that was missing.
RxTools installer known issues and limitations
1. During the installation of RxTools on Linux some warnings may appear on the console
output. This is normal and can typically be ignored.
2. When downgrading RxTools from an installed version 16.0.0 or higher to a version be-
fore 16.0.0, the existing installation must ﬁrst be uninstalled by explicitly executing the
uninstaller.
3. The Windows RxTools drivers and installer are signed with a SHA256 certiﬁcate. When
the "Microsoft Security Advisory 3033929: Availability of SHA-2 Code Signing Sup-
port for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2" (https://technet.microsoft.com/en-
us/library/security/3033929) is not installed on your system it might be that the drivers
are not working. Installing the Microsoft update ﬁxes the problem.
4. The RxTools installer on Linux requests root permissions via sudo. If sudo never has
been used, an error dialog might be shown during the installation but the installation
will continue and succeed.
5. When installing RxTools on a Linux machine, it is possible that the uninstallation step
fails. The user then receives a message that the installation directory is not empty and
is asked to select another directory. If this happens, please make sure to uninstall Rx-
Tools (by running the uninstaller executable in the installation directory, and restart the
installer.

RXTOOLS 25.0.0
RxTools general differences introduced in RxTools v22.1.0
Issues resolved in RxTools general:
1. Added the ﬁelds PPPSource and PPPAmbiguities to the FOCTURNStatusSBF block.
RxTools general differences introduced in RxTools v22.0.0
No differences
RxTools general differences introduced in RxTools v21.0.0
No differences
RxTools general differences introduced in RxTools v20.0.0
New features in RxTools general:
1. Support is added for extra BeiDou PRNs above C37.
2. On Linux, RxTools applications are by default launched in the background: when in-
voking the runXYZ scripts (e.g. runRxUpgrade), the terminal is not blocked. The --wait
option has been added in RxTools for Linux to change this behavior. This can be useful
in scripts to block script continuation until the application ﬁnishes.
3. Support is added for the BeiDou B2b signal.
Issues resolved in RxTools general:
1. IRNSS has been renamed to NavIC.
RxTools general differences introduced in RxTools v19.0.0
Issues resolved in RxTools general:
1. Support for playing/analyzing PolaRx2 ﬁles has been removed from the graphical Rx-
Tools.
RxTools general known issues and limitations
1. When using large display fonts, some parts of the user interface may not be displayed
appropriately, discarding information or showing scroll bars or overlapping text. If this
poses a problem, consider conﬁguring your display using a text scaling of 100% (or 96
DPI).
2. When data is sent over the serial port at a high rate to an RxTools graphical application,
CRC errors may occur. This is a limitation of the serial port of the PC equipment being
used rather than of the RxTools graphical application itself.
3. Due to high amounts of data provided by the SBF messages, when logging at high data
rates of above 5 Hz it is strongly advised to log the minimum amount of blocks needed.
Logging of all possible data blocks may result in data gaps. When logging at data rates
above 1 Hz please use the USB connection.
4. When opening the "Help Topics" from an RxTools application, some web browsers fail
to navigate to the relevant help page. The page can be reached by clicking the cor-
responding link in the table of contents. In some browsers the index tab is also not
working properly.
5. RxTools requires GLIBCXX version 3.4.15 or higher on Linux platforms.
5

RXTOOLS 25.0.0
6. The RxTools applications need a secure link for some operations (e.g. to check if a
newer version is available). Unfortunately new Linux distributions are shipped with a
new OpenSSL library which is not backwards compatible with the one used to com-
pile RxTools. In order to solve this problem, please install the OpenSSL compatibility
libraries (e.g. on Fedora this is the package compat-openssl10).
RxControl v25.0.0
RxControl is a graphical user interface application which facilitates control and monitoring of
Septentrio receivers in real time. Among different features it allows conﬁguration of Septen-
trio receivers in a user friendly way, offers multiple views for monitoring data and offers a
simple logger allowing you to record SBF ﬁles of the raw data you are receiving. To connect
your receiver to RxControl, follow the instructions provided in the manual.
RxControl differences to previous versions
RxControl differences introduced in RxTools v25.0.0
Issues resolved in RxControl:
1. C/N0 TimePlot shows now the LBand C/N0.
2. Spectrum plot shows now the frequency bands.
RxControl differences introduced in RxTools v24.0.0
Issues resolved in RxControl:
1. RxTools now supports visualization of NavIC L1 signal.

3. DiffCorr Info view now shows Base Station ID of incoming RTCMv3 message types 1303,
1304, 1334 and 1335.
4. The timeplot time series "SVs in Track" and "SVs in PVT" are renamed to "Tracked SVs"
and "Used SVs". The numbers shown are now also split per antenna and are no longer
a combined value.
5. Improved readability of the AGC Table view.
6. The NTRIP forwarding capability has been added to RxControl. For this a menu entry
"RxControl NTRIP Forwarder" has been added to the Communication menu.

RXTOOLS 25.0.0
RxControl differences introduced in RxTools v22.1.0
Issues resolved in RxControl:
1. The (Galileo) OSNMA authentication status is now visible in the RxControl satellite visu-
alisation.
RxControl differences introduced in RxTools v22.0.0
Issues resolved in RxControl:
1. Changing the constellation order via the preferences no longer causes RxControl to
become unresponsive and close.
RxControl differences introduced in RxTools v21.0.0
New features in RxControl:
1. The DiffCorr LED in the status bar has been replaced by an icon that indicates whether
differential corrections are being received and/or sent.
2. The IMU Widget can now also show the data from a Velocity sensor if such a sensor is
available.
Issues resolved in RxControl:
1. An issue has been ﬁxed that caused the re-connection to the receiver after upgrading
over USB to fail.
RxControl differences introduced in RxTools v20.0.0
New features in RxControl:
1. The entry of time schedules for log sessions has been improved. (This feature is only
available on certain receivers.)
RxControl differences introduced in RxTools v19.0.0
New features in RxControl:
1. The connection dialog has been improved. For existing connection items, information
is shown about the receiver that is related to the item. Items also reﬂect whether the
receiver (or ﬁle) is still available or not. (The polling of receivers can be disabled in the
preferences.) It is now also possible to connect using the same TCP/IP connection in
multiple instances of RxControl (or RxDownload/RxLogger) at the same time.
2. The Message Inspector offers a search box to ﬁlter messages and submessages. It is
now for example possible to show measurement info for a given satellite.
3. The Signals time plot readability has improved by rendering thicker lines if only a few
satellites are shown in the plot.
Issues resolved in RxControl:
1. An issue has been ﬁxed in the receiver settings windows, such that the command-
speciﬁc help links work correctly again.
2. The External Sensor Measurements timeplot now shows the measurements at full rate,
where in the past this time plot showed subsampled data.

--- Page 8 ---
RXTOOLS 25.0.0
3. An issue has been resolved in the preferences, where the reference position height was
not correctly updated when dragging the reference position in the map.
RxControl known issues and limitations
1. SBF communication from the receiver to RxControl depends on the conﬁgured update
rate and on the data needed for the current open views. If many views are open at a
high data rate (e.g. 10 Hz), this may lead to a high CPU load of the receiver. Also, make
sure that the connection to the receiver provides the necessary bandwidth: e.g. using
a serial connection at typical baud rates will not support 10 Hz updates.
2. In certain conﬁgurations, RxControl may have diﬃculties to connect to a receiver after
it has been reset. This can happen if the receiver’s boot conﬁg has the "ASCII Display"
output turned on for the port used by RxControl to communicate with the receiver.
3. In the planimetric plot, the distance between gridlines that are rendered when the
Geodetic Grid is enabled does not correspond to the length of the scale bar. Please
use the scale bar to interpret distances in the plot.
4. If a height plot already contains data, and then PVT is lost, during the time that there is
no PVT, the height time plot is blank. If PVT is available again, the height data appears
again (including the data from before the PVT loss).
5. When opening the height time plot or the ENU time plot, the historic data for the In-
tegration Mode and GNSS Attitude Mode may not be ﬁlled in correctly. The new data
that is appended after the plot is opened is correct.
6. The default number of digits used for the representation of certain ﬁelds in bin2asc or
the message inspector may be insuﬃcient. When more precision is needed, bin2asc
allows to specify the required precision.
7. In speciﬁc conﬁgurations, such as on Linux with a serial to Ethernet converter, it may
take a long time to detect which serial ports are available. When launching the applica-
tion or when opening a new connection, this may cause the application to temporarily
stop responding for some time (up to tens of seconds).
8. Filtering PVT modes through the Time Plot Options dialog does not work as expected.
9. When converting between Cartesian, geodetic coordinates and ENU coordinates, it is
assumed that the reported coordinates are in a datum that uses the WGS84/GRS80
ellipsoid. This assumption does not always hold when the receiver is conﬁgured to use
another geodetic datum. In this case, the reported coordinates can be wrong.
10. If the planimetric plot contains positions in multiple datums, no datum transformation
is applied. Each position is plotted at the coordinates that correspond to its own da-
tum.
11. The conversion between Cartesian and geodetic standard deviation values is wrong.
When plotting the Position Standard Deviation Cartesian Time Plot or the Position
Standard Deviation Geodetic Time Plot, make sure the SBF ﬁle has the corresponding
PosCovCartesian or PosCovGeodetic block or in RxControl the corresponding Coordi-
nate System is conﬁgured in the preferences.
12. As of RxTools 16.4.0, RxControl reports the value measured by the temperature sensor
in the Status tab. For selected receivers without temperature sensor (PolaRx4 Product
Group and AsteRx2eH), this will show a value of 0 degrees Celsius.
13. After a network glitch, it might happen that a popup is shown to request the NTRIP
format when using the NTRIP forward feature.

RXTOOLS 25.0.0
Data Link v25.0.0
Data Link is a graphical communication terminal with multiple ports which allows users to
establish and forward connections between a receiver and other devices connected in se-
rial, UDP/TCP/IP ports and/or NTRIP. Data Link is handy to use when transmitting Differential
corrections (RTCM, CMR, etc.) to different ports, when setting up a Dial-up modem connec-
tion, when making an NTRIP client connection or when using command line scripts to set up
communication devices.

to the clipboard to fail in certain cases.
Data Link differences introduced in RxTools v19.0.0
No differences
Data Link known issues and limitations
1. Data Link may on rare occasions hang, taking 100% of the capacity of the PC’s CPU. In
this situation go to the Task Manager and end the Data Link process manually. Then
restart Data Link.
2. During a congested connection Data Link may crash. The time it takes before the crash
occurs depends on your PC’s memory availability and the amount of congestion. To
remedy the problem, restart Data Link and reduce the connection load.

--- Page 10 ---
RXTOOLS 25.0.0
3. When using the "Log File" feature, note that the log ﬁle is kept open as long as the
option is enabled or the program is running (regardless of the connection state).
4. After a network outage, a TCP/IP client (or host) connection in Data Link might show
it is still connected, while the host (or client) has already closed the connection. When
this happens, disconnect and reconnect the client (or host) connection.
SBF Converter v25.0.0
SBF Converter is an application that allows to convert SBF log ﬁles to various formats, in-
cluding ASCII, RINEX, KML (Google Earth). It is an intuitive GUI shell around the underlying
command-line conversion tools. SBF Converter also allows conversion of multiple ﬁles at
once.
SBF Converter differences to previous versions
SBF Converter differences introduced in RxTools v25.0.0

result window.
10

--- Page 11 ---
RXTOOLS 25.0.0
2. Session support has been added to make it possible to switch fast between several
conﬁgurations.
SBF Converter known issues and limitations
1. When a conversion is cancelled, temporary ﬁles may not be deleted.
2. For the RINEX conversion, when the "Add sequence number in IGS output ﬁle name"
check box is checked and multiple ﬁles are being converted, neither SBF Converter nor
sbf2rin will be comparing the time inside the input ﬁles and ﬁguring out the right ﬁle
sequence. Therefore, please make sure that the input ﬁles in the Multiple File Selection
dialog appear in the correct sequential order from top to bottom.
3. Conversion to KML assumes the SBF ﬁle contains positions in WGS84. If the SBF ﬁle
contains positions in another datum, the KML ﬁle will show position errors introduced
by the datum difference.
4. Conversion to GPX assumes the SBF ﬁle contains positions in WGS84. If the SBF ﬁle
contains positions in another datum, the GPX ﬁle will show position errors introduced
by the datum difference.
SBF Analyzer v25.0.0
SBF Analyzer is a GUI application designed to analyze data from SBF log ﬁles. Similar to Rx-
Control, SBF Analyzer allows visualization of multiple time plots as well as visualization of his-
toric information in the SBF log ﬁle. It is a powerful tool when deep analysis of data recorded
by Septentrio receivers is needed. As its output, SBF Analyzer can either open application
windows allowing to interact with the plots much in the same way as in RxControl, but also
offers the possibility to generate PDF documents following fully customizable templates.
SBF Analyzer differences to previous versions
SBF Analyzer differences introduced in RxTools v25.0.0
Issues resolved in SBF Analyzer:
1. C/N0 TimePlot shows now the LBand C/N0.
2. Spectrum plot shows now the frequency bands.

Issues resolved in SBF Analyzer:
1. An issue is ﬁxed in the Signals Used In File table in the General File Information view,
where in certain cases some signals were wrongly reported as being used in PVT.
SBF Analyzer differences introduced in RxTools v19.0.0
New features in SBF Analyzer:
1. SBF Analyzer can now compare the analyzed SBF ﬁle with secondary data from another
SBF ﬁle or from Spirent scenario truth data. The following comparisons can be plotted:
Position Error, Velocity Error, Satellite Position Error, Satellite Velocity Error, Pseudor-
ange Error, Doppler Error, Iono Delay Difference, Tropo Delay Difference, C/N0 Differ-
ence.
2. SBF Analyzer time interval ﬁltering now allows to specify a number of minutes to be
processed at the beginning or at the end of the ﬁle.
3. Session support has been added to make it possible to switch fast between several
conﬁgurations.
4. The Signals time plot readability has improved by rendering thicker lines if only a few
satellites are shown in the plot.
Issues resolved in SBF Analyzer:
1. The External Sensor Measurements timeplot now shows the measurements at full rate,
where in the past this time plot showed subsampled data.
2. An issue has been resolved in the preferences, where the reference position height was
not correctly updated when dragging the reference position in the map.
SBF Analyzer known issues and limitations
1. A PDF ﬁle created by the reporter may show on screen some small inconsistencies in
the colors that are used to represent data. On print the colors are consistent.
2. In certain circumstances, time plot legends may have too many entries to ﬁt in the
allocated area. The entries may be displayed overlapping and become unreadable.
12

--- Page 13 ---
RXTOOLS 25.0.0
3. When post-processing a ﬁle with SBF Analyzer the local time that is shown is not the
local time of were the ﬁle is recorded, but the local time with the settings as speciﬁed
in your PC’s locale.
4. In the planimetric plot, the distance between gridlines that are rendered when the
Geodetic Grid is enabled does not correspond to the length of the scale bar. Please
use the scale bar to interpret distances in the plot.
5. If a planimetric plot is open at the time a new analysis is started, that planimetric plot
will be closed.
6. Filtering PVT modes through the Time Plot Options dialog does not work as expected.
7. The Message Statistics tab in the General File Information window reports gaps in the
occurrences of regular rate SBF messages. However, it does not detect missing mes-
sages at the very beginning of the ﬁle, i.e. gaps between the ﬁrst and the second oc-
currence of a given SBF message type.
8. When converting between Cartesian, geodetic coordinates and ENU coordinates, it is
assumed that the reported coordinates are in a datum that uses the WGS84/GRS80
ellipsoid. This assumption does not always hold when the receiver is conﬁgured to use
another geodetic datum. In this case, the reported coordinates can be wrong.
9. If the planimetric plot contains positions in multiple datums, no datum transformation
is applied. Each position is plotted at the coordinates that correspond to its own da-
tum.
10. The conversion between Cartesian and geodetic standard deviation values is wrong.
When plotting the Position Standard Deviation Cartesian Time Plot or the Position
Standard Deviation Geodetic Time Plot, make sure the SBF ﬁle has the corresponding
PosCovCartesian or PosCovGeodetic block or in RxControl the corresponding Coordi-
nate System is conﬁgured in the preferences.
RxLogger v25.0.0
RxLogger is a GUI application which provides advanced logging capability. Its main feature
is support of logging on multiple streams, where an SBF frequency rate can be speciﬁed per
stream. RxLogger also offers post-processing actions of SBF ﬁles such as conversion to RINEX
format, conversion to CGGTTS format, FTP transfers, compression as well as custom actions
ideal for reference receivers.

preferences.) It is now also possible to connect using the same TCP/IP connection in
multiple instances of RxControl (or RxDownload/RxLogger) at the same time.
RxLogger known issues and limitations
1. In speciﬁc conﬁgurations, such as on Linux with a serial to Ethernet converter, it may

RxUpgrade known issues and limitations
1. Rarely it happens that RxUpgrade becomes unresponsive. This does not necessarily
mean that the upgrade has failed. RxControl can be used to check the ﬁrmware version
of the receiver: Help -> Receiver Identiﬁcation.
2. When starting RxUpgrade in batch mode it can happen that RxUpgrade becomes un-
responsive just after starting. In that case RxUpgrade needs to be restarted again.
3. When upgrading the receiver over an Ethernet connection, no other client should be
connected to the receiver. Otherwise, there is a risk that the upgrade procedure is not
successful.
4. When using the -c command line option to specify a connection ﬁle, please specify a
connection ﬁle name without path. The connection ﬁle is then looked up in the ".septen-
trio" folder in the users home folder.
RxDownload v25.0.0

RxDownload differences introduced in RxTools v19.0.0
New features in RxDownload:
1. The connection dialog has been improved. For existing connection items, information
is shown about the receiver that is related to the item. Items also reﬂect whether the
receiver (or ﬁle) is still available or not. (The polling of receivers can be disabled in the
preferences.) It is now also possible to connect using the same TCP/IP connection in
multiple instances of RxControl (or RxDownload/RxLogger) at the same time.
Issues resolved in RxDownload:
1. When using RxDownload to download ﬁles from a receiver that has logging enabled
to multiple sessions (only supported by certain receivers), a bug has been ﬁxed that
caused only new ﬁles from one session to be downloaded, while the other sessions
were skipped.
RxDownload known issues and limitations
1. When downloading large ﬁles, the CPU on the receiver can go up to 100%. This can
cause data gaps in the receiver’s logged data.
2. In speciﬁc conﬁgurations, such as on Linux with a serial to Ethernet converter, it may
take a long time to detect which serial ports are available. When launching the applica-
tion or when opening a new connection, this may cause the application to temporarily
stop responding for some time (up to tens of seconds).
RxPlanner v25.0.0
RxPlanner is an intuitive stand-alone Satellite Mission planning software tool offering the de-
termination of the visibility of GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO and Geostationary satellites in func-
tion of time and location, and of the resulting dilution of precision. The tool gives an estimate
of the potential quality of a GNSS solution, and provides suggestions on appropriate times
for surveying.

1. In certain situations, RxPlanner may attempt to download from the Celestrak website
a YUMA or SEM almanac that has not yet been made available.
2. The ’Update Almanacs’ button may become disabled (greyed out). Temporarily select-
ing another method for any constellation or toggling the ’Use same method for all con-
stellations’ checkbox, enables the button again.
3. On certain Linux distributions, RxPlanner may fail to download almanac ﬁles from the
Septentrio website. For this download SSL is used. Unfortunately new Linux distribu-
tions are shipped with a new OpenSSL library that is not backwards compatible with
the one used to compile RxTools. If you experience this problem, please install the
OpenSSL compatibility libraries (e.g. on Fedora this is the package compat-openssl10).
RxAssistant v25.0.0
RxAssistant is an application offering simple conﬁguration of a receiver for common tasks
and/or connectivity to other GPS applications (GIS, Surveying, etc). It among others provides
basic status monitoring, Ntrip as well as the conﬁguration of NMEA output.

1. When RxAssistant is quit, or when the connection to the receiver is closed, the vari-
ous settings, in particular the NMEA settings, persist. It is advised to keep RxAssistant
running always when the receiver is used.
2. If the receiver does not have a valid position (and no ﬁxed position is conﬁgured), estab-
lising an Ntrip connection may fail if the stream requires your position. In this scenario
however, a meaningless error message "Connection congested" will be shown in the
Ntrip tab.

1. When extracting generic measurements (using –extractGenMeas), the last measure-
ments epoch could be dropped from the output ﬁle. If this is the case, output of this
last measurement epoch can be ensured by including the EndOfMeas SBF block in the
log ﬁle.
2. The bin2asc tool may still change in the future with respect to its interface and output
format. The message names to be used for message selection may change. The ﬁelds,
their order, and the way they are formatted may change.
3. The default number of digits used for the representation of certain ﬁelds in bin2asc or
the message inspector may be insuﬃcient. When more precision is needed, bin2asc
allows to specify the required precision.
